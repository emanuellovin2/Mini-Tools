# [PLATFORM]

A multi-sided marketplace where developers list SaaS apps and sell them on subscription; affiliates bring users via referral links; resellers run their own storefronts with markup over a vendor-set floor. The platform owns billing, access, and distribution.

**Economics at a glance:**
- **Vendor (direct sale):** platform takes 12%/8%/5%/3% by trailing monthly net tier ($0–$1k / $1k–$3k / $3k–$10k / $10k+). Computed on net amount (after Stripe fees). **No flat fee.**
- **Affiliate (referral):** vendor sets `affiliate_commission_bps` per app (20–80%). On affiliate sales: platform takes **5% of net**, affiliate gets their set %, vendor keeps the rest. Affiliate tier: 20%/25%/30% at $0/$5k/$20k active MRR generated. Commission snapshotted at subscribe time — tier changes only affect new subs.
- **Reseller (storefront):** pays **$19/month** for platform access (30-day free trial). On each sale: vendor gets `min_price` floor, platform takes **5% of markup** (Tier 1) or **2.5% of markup** (Tier 2 WL), reseller keeps the rest. Vendor with `open_to_wl` gets 33% kickback on platform commission (both tiers).

## Next.js version note
This project uses **Next.js 16** — breaking API changes not reflected in most LLM training data. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (start with `01-app/`) before writing any Next.js-specific code.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev && npm run typecheck && npm test
npm test -- --run <path>   # single test file
npm run types              # regenerate types/supabase.ts
supabase start / stop / db push
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks
```

## Read these first
1. **`SPEC.md`** — source of truth: architecture, roles, pricing, schema, business rules.
2. **`BUILD_PROMPTS.md`** — ordered build plan index (files in `build_prompts/`).
3. **`ENGINEERING.md`** — engineering principles (money as cents/bps, Separate Charges & Transfers, idempotent webhooks, RLS, strict TS).

## Data models (non-obvious schema decisions)

**Reseller (as of #29)**
- `profiles.reseller_openness` (`closed|open_to_resellers|open_to_wl`; default `open_to_resellers`) — vendor-set. Only affects reseller sales.
- `reseller_offers.wl_tier` (1|2), `wl_status`, `wl_stripe_subscription_id` (UNIQUE per offer), per-offer branding columns.
- `subscriptions.reseller_wl_tier_snapshot / vendor_openness_snapshot` — immutable after subscribe.
- `VENDOR_WL_KICKBACK_BPS = 3333` in `lib/stripe/transfers.ts` — never inline.

**Screenshots (as of #30)**
- `solutions.screenshot_urls text[]` — first element = marketplace hero. CHECK: cardinality 0 (pending) or 3–7 (active). Approved require ≥3.
- Storage bucket `app-screenshots`: public read, vendor-prefixed write.

**Design system v2 (as of #31)**
- Tokens in `app/globals.css`: `--font-size-base: 13px`, `--primary: 245 100% 68%` (#635bff), `--sidebar-w: 232px`, `--topbar-h: 56px`. Dark mode via `html[data-theme="dark"]`.
- Primitives: `Drawer` (520px, focus trap), `Sparkline`, `KpiCard`, `DenseTable/Row/Cell`, `EmptyState`, `Tooltip`, `OnboardingChecklist`, `NotificationBell`, `CommandPalette` (⌘K). No new primitives without reason.
- Per-role layouts in `app/{vendor,affiliate,admin,reseller}/layout.tsx` wrap DashboardShell.

**Affiliate (as of #25)**
- `profiles.affiliate_active_mrr_cents` drives tier + leaderboard. `profiles.slug` UNIQUE globally (NULL = opted out).
- `affiliate_badges` — static lookup; earned badges via `affiliate_earned_badges(p_affiliate_id)` RPC.
- Public MRR must be **rounded** (nearest $100) — exact figures expose subscriber counts.

**Organizations (as of #47)**
- `organizations`: `id, name, slug (nullable for personal), type (personal|team)`. Stripe Connect columns live here (not profiles).
- `org_members`: `(org_id, user_id)` UNIQUE, `role (owner|admin|member)`. Index: `(user_id, org_id) INCLUDE (role)`.
- `jobs`: durable async queue — erasure, export, analytics rollup, settlement, webhook delivery.
- `org_quotas`: default-deny for every new resource type. Every creatable resource MUST have quota + enforcement.
- `audit_log.actor_org_id`: stamp on every mutation. `writeAuditLog` in same transaction.
- `apps/reseller_offers/affiliate_links/vendor_billing` gain `org_id`. `profiles.role` = platform role; `org_members.role` = within-org.

**Analytics (as of #46)**
- `analytics_events`: append-only, monthly partition, 90d raw retention. `visitor_hash` = salted daily-rotating HMAC (null on DNT/GPC). No PII, no raw IP.
- `analytics_daily`: rollup kept indefinitely. `analytics-rollup-cron` (0 3 * * *) → `rollup_analytics_day(date)` RPC.
- `POST /api/events`: batched (max 20), rate-limited 60/min/IP, bot-filtered.
- `ANALYTICS_SALT_SECRET` required env var (falls back to `dev-salt-not-for-production` with warning).

**Solutions abstraction (as of #49)**
- `solutions` table (renamed from `apps`). Legacy `CREATE VIEW apps AS SELECT * FROM solutions` — existing code works unchanged.
- `solution_type enum('saas'|'agent'|'workflow'|'bundle') DEFAULT 'saas'`. Non-SaaS types gated by `SOLUTIONS_NON_SAAS_ENABLED=true`.
- New columns: `runtime_config jsonb`, `template_of_id uuid`, `is_template bool`, `solution_version text (semver)`, `tenant_shard_id smallint DEFAULT 0`.
- `solution_versions` table — capped at 50 per solution. Triggers: type immutability after approval, no bundle-in-bundle, semver no-downgrade.
- All marketplace listing pages route through `solutionsIndex` (`lib/search/solutions.ts`) — never raw table queries from page code.
- Zod discriminated union per type in `lib/types/solutions.ts`. `lib/services/solutions.ts` for CRUD + template fork + version history.

## How to work
- Build one numbered prompt at a time. Tick it in Progress when done.
- Tech stack (do not swap): Next.js App Router TS, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe Connect, Resend, JWT RS256.
- See `lib/validation/env.ts` for the authoritative list of environment variables + which task requires each.

## Progress
**Phase 0–2 (done):** #1–#14 all complete.

**Phase 3 Wave 1–6 (done):** #15–#26 all complete (pricing tiers, design system, affiliate redesign, refund policy, subscription pause, vendor analytics, affiliate leaderboard, docs sync, weekly payouts, reseller trial).

**Phase 4 Wave 7 (done):** #27 vendor commission override, #28 security hardening v2, #29 WL Tier 2.

**Phase 5 Wave 8 (done):** #30–#39 all complete (screenshots gallery, design system v2, vendor/affiliate/reseller/buyer/admin dashboard v2, marketplace v2, fee transparency, cross-role notifications/settings/onboarding/CSV/webhooks/partner API).

**Phase 6 — Wave 9 (Stripe + Shopify for AI agencies)**

Repositioning: infrastructure agencies use to build agent-powered businesses for SMB clients. BYOK + prepaid credits = zero compute cost to platform. `agency↔client relationship` as primary op unit. `deployments` (not subscriptions) for agent/workflow/bundle. Foundation ordering: **#47 → #48 → #46 → #49 → #54 → #50 → #51 → #40–#44 → #52+#53 → #45**.

- [x] #47 Organizations & multi-seat — `organizations`, `org_members`, personal-org bootstrap, RLS via `is_org_member`, payouts move to org, `audit_log.actor_org_id`
- [x] #48 Scale & resilience — durable `jobs` queue + tick worker, `org_quotas` + enforce, statement_timeout middleware, outbound webhook delivery, k6 smoke harness, Stripe retry wrapper
- [x] #46 Analytics event capture — `analytics_events` (monthly partition, privacy-safe), rollup cron, real funnels (affiliate EPC, reseller traffic, vendor impression)
- [x] #49 Solutions abstraction — `apps→solutions` rename + legacy view, `solution_type` enum, `runtime_config`, `template_of_id`, `solution_versions`, search interface, `SOLUTIONS_NON_SAAS_ENABLED` flag
- [ ] #54 Wave 9 scale invariants — search abstraction (`lib/search/`), read-replica routing (`lib/db/with-replica.ts`, `freshRequired` for money reads), `organizations.region` + downstream denorm, tenant noisy-neighbor (SET LOCAL app.org_id, pg_cron kill, per-role connection budget), `settlement_batches` (1 transfer/recipient/day), OAuth stampede mitigation, hot-wallet sharding seam (`credit_wallets.shard_count`), `idempotency_keys_v2` (sharded TTL partitions), custom-domain SSL via Cloudflare for SaaS (feature-flagged), `lib/reserved-slugs.ts` single source, cold-storage router stub. ENGINEERING.md §12 + k6 extensions. **Cross-cutting seams that #40–#53 consume.**
- [ ] #50 Agency ↔ Client + Deployments — `organization_type` extended (`agency`|`client`), `client_relationships` (one active agency per client), `solution_deployments` as op unit for non-SaaS (SaaS keeps subscriptions), `getEffectiveConfig` Redis-cached (5min + 30s LRU), RLS trust boundaries. **BLOCKS #51–#53, refits #40–#44.**
- [ ] #51 Outcome metrics seam — `deployment_metrics` (daily partition, append-only), `emitMetric` idempotent, reserved namespaces (`lead.*`/`meeting.*`/`task.*`/`time.*`/`revenue.*`/`cost.*`/`quality.*`), k≥5 anonymity on benchmarks, PII dimension guard, incremental 15-min rollup with watermark.
- [ ] #40 Usage metering + billing — `usage_events.deployment_id` refit, prepaid `credit_wallets`, settlement cron, `computeUsageSplit` pure fn (vendor/agency/platform/reseller/affiliate). **BLOCKS #41–#44.**
- [ ] #41 AI Gateway (BYOK) — per-deployment key routing (vendor/agency/client BYOK), spend caps, encrypted `provider_keys` vault, `/api/gateway/[provider]` metered proxy.
- [ ] #42 Workflow engine — `workflows/versions/runs/run_steps`, triggers (manual/schedule/webhook), durable tick executor, sellable templates. Runs scoped to deployments.
- [ ] #43 Connectors — OAuth owned by client_org, delegated to deployment; versioned registry (Gmail/Slack/Sheets/HTTP), encrypted `connector_accounts`.
- [ ] #44 Usage-product distribution — agency forks vendor templates → customises → deploys under agency brand; metered marketplace products, reseller per-unit markup, affiliate recurring %.
- [ ] #52 Agency operations dashboard — `/agency` route (org.type='agency' only), client-centric health board, `client_health_scores` precomputed hourly, `computeChurnRisk` pure fn, cursor pagination (no OFFSET), Stripe Connect balance + payouts.
- [ ] #53 Client portal — `/client` + subdomain WL (reuses #29 proxy pattern), branding from active agency relationship cached in signed cookie (1h) + Redis `branding_version:*`, outcome charts, credit wallet, privacy panel, agency-branded emails via jobs queue, "Hosted by [PLATFORM]" footer mandatory.
- [ ] #45 DPA + partner-client data lifecycle — `partner_clients` CRM, cross-deployment erasure/export, retention cron, `/legal/dpa`. Depends on #40/#41/#43/#50.

## Guardrails
- Never expose buyer email, name, or card data to vendors, resellers, or affiliates. `subscriptions.buyer_id` has no read path for non-admin roles (SPEC §6/§7).
- A user can never change their own `role` (privilege-escalation guard, RLS — SPEC §8).
- All money moves through Stripe Connect via **Separate Charges & Transfers**. **Voluntary refunds** (`charge.refunded`) reverse vendor transfer only — platform/affiliate/reseller keep cuts. **Disputes** (`charge.dispute.closed` lost) reverse ALL transfers for that invoice.
- `subscriptions` row: AT MOST ONE of `affiliate_id` / `reseller_id`. Reseller-sold takes priority — clear affiliate cookie if both collide.
- Reseller-sold revenue does NOT count toward `vendor_billing.gross_revenue_cents` (vendor tier = direct + affiliate only).
- The reseller's $19/mo subscription is on the **platform account** (not Connect). Lapse → new offers + new sales blocked (`reseller_offers.status` forced to `paused`).
- Vendor cut precedence: `profiles.vendor_cut_bps_override` (admin-set, 0–5000) → `vendor_billing.cut_bps` (auto-tier) → 1200 default. `guard_vendor_cut_override` DB trigger blocks self-set.
- Entitlement is DB-reconciled from Stripe webhooks — never grant access off a client redirect.
- Webhook handlers and any path writing to ≥2 tables MUST run in a single DB transaction (Supabase RPC or explicit BEGIN/COMMIT).
- `anon_user_id` is stable per `(buyer_id, app_id)` across resubscriptions — look up prior id before generating new.
- All admin mutations write to `audit_log` in same transaction via `writeAuditLog`. Immutable (no UPDATE/DELETE RLS).
- Webhook endpoints are exempt from rate limiting. Never add rate limiting to `/api/webhooks`.
- `VENDOR_WL_KICKBACK_BPS = 3333` exported const — never inline. CI fuzz (1000 iters) must satisfy sum invariant + non-negative platform cut.
- Brand uploads: PNG/JPG/WebP only (no SVG — XSS), 1MB max, magic-bytes verified. Display name passes homoglyph deny-list in `lib/validation/wl-brand.ts`.
- Subdomain enumeration: inactive/non-existent Tier 2 → 404. `/buyer` NEVER WL-branded — redirect to canonical domain (anti-poaching).
- Reserved subdomains in `proxy.ts`: www/api/admin/auth/app/dashboard/support/help/mail/email/ftp/ns1/ns2/staging/dev/test/prod.
- **RLS performance:** `is_org_member()` and any RLS helper MUST be `STABLE SECURITY DEFINER`. Hot tables use `org_id = ANY(SELECT my_org_ids())` not per-row scalar calls. Never `auth.uid()` in per-row subqueries on large tables.
- **Migration safety on hot tables:** never ADD COLUMN NOT NULL DEFAULT (full rewrite). Never CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY. Never ADD CONSTRAINT without NOT VALID + VALIDATE. Pattern: add nullable → batch backfill via jobs → set NOT NULL.
- **Every new creatable resource** MUST declare a quota in `org_quotas` + call `enforceQuota()`. Default-deny; never allow unbounded creation.
- **Anti-poaching (Wave 9):** vendor identity never exposed to client for agency-operated deployments. "Hosted by [PLATFORM]" footer required on all `/client` pages. Agency brand, not vendor brand, shown to clients.
